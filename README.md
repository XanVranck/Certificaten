This project is a good example for using __Travis__ when there is a problem with __Travis__ itself. __Travis__ didn't recognize jdk 8 at first *(it was just the file that was wrongly formatted)*, but after a while I got it working.

This is also a good exercise on __Hibernate__ and databases. Just trying things out and try not to burn IntelliJ. *Doing my best!*
